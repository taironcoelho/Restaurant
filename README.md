# Restaurant - Guided project from the book "App development with Swift- Apple Inc. - Education, 2017. iBooks"

It's an app for iOS, with an interactive menu for a restaurant that allows the customer to view a list of offerings, 
add items to an order, and submit the order to the restaurant. 
Using a server that you'll run on your own computer, you'll have an opportunity to modify the options, descriptions,
and images that are returned from the API.
